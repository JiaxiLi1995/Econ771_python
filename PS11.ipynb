Test whether schooling is predetermined by the $C$ statistic. To calculate $C$, you need to do two GMMs with and without schooling as an instrument. Use the same $\\hat{S}$ throughout. To calculate $\\hat{S}$, use the 2SLS residual from part (b). The $C$ statistic should be 58.168.**"

    "**(g) Go back to the wage equation you estimated in (e) by 2SLS endogenous schooling. The large Sargan's statistic (and the large J statistic in part (f)) is a concern. So consider dropping both MED and KWW from the list of instruments. Is the order condition for identification still satisfied? What happens to the 2SLS estimates? (The schooling coefficient will be -529.3%!) What do you think is the problem? Hint: There are two endogenous regressors, S and IQ. MRT and AGE are the only excluded predetermined variables. If MRT and AGE do not have explanatory power in the first-stage regression of S and IQ on the instruments, then the fitted values of S and IQ will be very close to linear combinations of the included predetermined variables. This will lead to a near multicollinearity problem in the second-stage regression. Make sure you examine the first-stage regressions to check the explanatory power of MRT and AGE.**"
