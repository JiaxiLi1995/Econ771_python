    "Read Griliches (1976) before answering. We will estimate the type of the wage equation estimated by Griliches using an extract from the NLS-Y used by Blackbum and Neumark (1992).\" The NLS-Y is panel data, with the same set of young men surveyed at several points in time (we will not exploit the panel feature of the data set in this exercise, though). The extract contains information about those individuals at two points in time: first, the earliest year in which wages and other variables are available, and second, in 1980. In a data file GRILIC.ASC, data are provided on RNS, RNS80, MRT, MRT80, SMSA, SMSA80, MED, IQ, KWW, YEAR, AGE, AGE80, S, S80, EXPR, EXPR80, TENURE, TENURE80, LW, and LW80 (in this order, with the columns corresponding to the variables, as usual). The variable YEAR is the year of the first point in time. Variables without \"80 are for the first point, and those with \"80\" are for 1980. The definition of the variables for the first point is:\n",
