    "In this exercise, you will estimate the speed of convergence using several different estimation techniques. We use the international panel constructed by Summers and Heston (1991), which has become the standard data set for studying the growth of nations. The Summers-Heston panel (also called the Penn World Table) includes major macro variables measured in a consistent basis for virtually all the countries of the world.\n",

    "The file *sum-hes.xls* is an extract for 1960-1985 from version 5.6 of the Penn World Table downloaded from the NBER's home page (www.nber.org). The file is organized as follows. For each country, the first two variables are dummies, one for a communist regime (referred to as *COM* below) and the other for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (referred to as *OPEC* below). The later variables are the population (*POP{year}*, in thousands), real GDP per capita (*Y{year}*, in 1985 U.S. dollars), and the saving rate (*SRATE{year}*, in percent) for each year. The third record has the same for 1961, and so forth. The twenty-seventh record of the country is for 1985.\n",
    "\n",
    "GDP per capita is the country's real GDP converted into U.S. dollars using the purchasing power parity of the country's currency against the dollar for 1985 (the variable \"RGDPCH\" in the Penn World Table). The saving rate is measured as the ratio of real investment to real GDP (\"I\" in the Penn World Table). See Sections II and III (particularly III.D) of Summers and Heston (1991) for how the variables are constructed. The first issue we examine empirically is conditional convergence. (At this juncture it would be useful to skim Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992).) Let $s_i$ be the saving rate of country $i$ and $n_i$ be the country's population growth rate (which we take to be the growth rate of labor). In the Solow-Swan growth model with a Cobb-Douglas production function, the steady-state level of output per effective labor, denoted $q^*$ in the text, is a linear function of $\\log(s_i) - log(n_i + g + \\delta)$, where $g$ is the rate of labor-augmenting technical progress and $\\delta$ is the depreciation rate of the capital stock. Then, assuming $A(0)$, the initial level of technology, to be the same across countries, equation (5.4.10) can be written\n",

    "The growth model implies that $\\gamma_1 = - \\gamma_2$, but we will not impose this restriction. This is the specification estimated in Table IV of Mankiw et al. (1992). As in Mankiw et a]., assume $\\rho + \\delta$ to be 5 percent for all countries, and take $s_i$ to be the saving rate averaged over the 1960-1985 period. We measure $n_i$ as the average annual population growth rate over the same period (Mankiw et al. uses the average growth rate of the working-age population). Because our sample of 125 countries includes (former) communist countries and OPEC, we add COM (= 1 if communist, 0 otherwise) and OPEC (= 1 if OPEC, 0 otherwise) to the equation:\n",

Plot $y_{i1} - y_{i0}$ against $y_{i0}$ for the 125 countries included in the sample. Is there any relation between the initial GDP ($y_{i0}$) and the subsequent growth ($y_{i1} - y_{i0}$)? Assuming outright that the error term is orthogonal to the regressors, estimate equation (2') by OLS. Calculate the value of $\\lambda$ (speed of convergence) implied by the OLS estimate of $\\rho$. (It should be less than 1 percent per year.) Calculate the asymptotic standard error (i.e., $1/n$ times the square root of the asymptotic variance) of your estimate of $\\lambda$.

The standard error of $\\hat{\\lambda}$ is $1/n$ times the square root of this. So: the standard error of $\\hat{\\lambda}$ = (standard error of $\\hat{\\rho}$)/($25 \\hat{\\rho}$).
